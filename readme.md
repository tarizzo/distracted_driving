# Distracted Driving Classifier

Distracted driving is a leading cause of motor vehicle
accidents. One of the most popular driver distractions is cellular
phones. This study utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
and time series data to predict if a driver is distracted. The
features used will include sensor data and user input data from
a automotive driving simulator. This paper will also detail the
data collection techniques utilized in this study
